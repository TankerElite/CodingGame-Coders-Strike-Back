### Bronze_Code.py - Code that beat the Bronze League and got me to Silver League
### Silver_Code.py - Code that beat the Silver League and got me to Gold League
### Gold_Code.py - Code that I used to prototype my Pod in the Gold League, so it worked with the new input.
### Final_Submission(Gold).cpp - Code that I used as my final submission as of now, which was Gold_Code.py rewritten into C++, with numerous additions.
